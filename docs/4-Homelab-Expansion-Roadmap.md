**Topic:** Sequencing the Learning Process.

1. **The Sandbox (Current):** Use the 2015 MacBook Pro to master the Nix language and build a working Hyprland environment.
2. **The Bridge:** Install the Nix Package Manager on the Mac Mini and Raspberry Pi to sync shell aliases via Home Manager before committing to full OS changes.
3. **The Fleet Expansion:** Purchase "Capable Hardware." Copy the MacBook's services modules, swap the hardware.nix for the new server's specs, and deploy.
4. **Remote Management:** Use the MacBook as a "Headless Controller" to push updates to the Server and Pi over the network.
